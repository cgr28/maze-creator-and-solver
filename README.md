## Usage
1. Select the algorithm that will be used to create the maze.
2. Select one or more algorithms that will be used to generate solutions. To generate a maze with no solutions select "None".
3. Select the height and width of the maze.  Choose if generated mazes will display the cells that were visited by the solver when finding the solution.
4. Click the "Create Maze(s)" button to have your maze(s) created.
5. To download png of a maze click the "Download" button beneath the maze.

*Creates a perfect maze (only one solution).*
### [Hunt And Kill](https://github.com/cgr28/maze-creator-and-solver/blob/main/backend/creator/maze_creators.py#L9) <br /> ![Hunt and Kill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgr28/maze-creator-and-solver/main/imgs/hunt-and-kill.png)
*Creates mazes that may have more than one solution. Takes the longest to generate mazes.*
